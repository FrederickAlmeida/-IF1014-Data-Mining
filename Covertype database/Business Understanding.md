1. Determine Business Objectives
    1.1 **Background** (Industry/sector, problem context, stakeholders)
   - Natural resource managers responsible for developing ecosystem management strategies require basic descriptive information including inventory data for forested lands to support their decision-making processes. However, managers generally do not have this type of data for inholdings or neighboring lands that are outside their immediate jurisdiction. One method of obtaining this information is through the use of predictive models.
   - Predicting which tree species will dominate specific areas of a forest may help in forest management, conservation, and planning.
   - The background could involve climate change affecting the forest composition or the need for optimized forest resource management.

    1.2 **Business Objectives** (general goals, specific objectives)
    - Main objective: Predict the dominant tree species in a given area of forest based on environmental features.
    - Supporting Objectives: Improve forest resource management by identifying forest cover type accurately, and assist in forest conservation efforts by predicting future forest compositions.
  
    1.3 **Business Success Criteria** (key performance indicators, KPI, business impact)
    - Model accuracy: Achieving a classification accuracy of at least 85% in predicting the correct tree species.
    - Operational Impact: Using the predictions to improve forest resource planning and management decisions, reducing operational costs related to mismanagement of forest areas.

2. Assess Situation
    2.1 **Inventory of Resources**
    - Data: Covertype dataset, that contains 54 cartographic features of a given observation with 30x30 meter cell, along with the covertype.
    - Tools and technologies: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) and jupyter notebook/google colab.
    - People: Frederick (data exploration, data cleaning, model bulding and evaluationing)

    2.2 **Requirements, Assumptions, and Constraints**
    - Technical requirements: Internet connection for using colab or a local environment for using the tools specified.
    - Data requirements: Dataset with sufficient diversity in environmental features for reliable training.
    - Assumptions: The data represents a diverse set of forests across different environmental conditions in Colorado, with a feature set good enough to classify cover types.
    - Constraints: Limited computational power (only free tier colab/local computers), and only environmental features and cover types, without more detailed data on forest health.

    2.3 **Risks and contigencies**
    - Data quality: If the dataset has missing or noisy data, this could affect the model performance. The data exploration stage will try to identify problems with the data, and correct them on the data cleaning stage.
    - Model performance: If the accuracy is below the desired value, this could make the project unviable. The contigencies would be trying other pre-processing techniques and different models.

    2.4 **Terminology**
    - Glossary for the stakeholders;
    - Cover type: The dominant tree species in a forest area.
    - Classification accuracy: The percentage of correctly predicted forest cover types in the dataset.
    - Feature engineering: The process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

    2.5 **Costs and Benefits**
    - Costs (data acquisition, time spent on data cleaning, cost of softwares/cloud services, and personnel costs): Time required from personnel.
    - Benefits (positive outcomes of the project, financial, reduced costs, incresead sales, or non-financial, improved decision-making, enhanced environmental sustainability): reduced costs by optimizing forest planning and conservation efforts.

3. Determine Data Science Goals
    3.1 **Data Science Goals**
    - Clean and preprocess the Covertype dataset.
    - Build a classification model to predict forest cover type.
    - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
    - Interpret the model's prediction (feature understanding).
  
    3.2 **Data Science Success Criteria**
    - Accuracy of at least 85%;
    - F1-score of at least 0.8, to balance precision and recall;
    - Make sure that the model's impacting the business.
